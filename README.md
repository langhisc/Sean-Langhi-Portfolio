# Sean Langhi's Portfolio

This repository contains work samples of technical writing, cross-functional collaboration, software architecture, engineering productivity development, design thinking, and general written communication.

Most of these samples are images or PDFs that can be opened and viewed directly in GitHub.

This portfolio is intended to enrich job applications, which may include a direct link to it.

Enjoy!
